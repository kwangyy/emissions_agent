# Question 2 Report

## Question
Are my scope 2 emissions calculation valid according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol?

## Answer
Complete analysis and answer:

Direct answer:
- No — the current scope 2 calculations in the provided scope2.csv are not fully valid against GHG Protocol requirements in their present state. The dataset contains several data-quality and calculation issues that violate GHG Protocol expectations for transparency, correct unit usage, and verifiability. These issues must be remediated before the inventory can be considered valid for reporting or verification.

Evidence and cross-reference to GHG Protocol guidance:
- GHG Protocol requires Scope 2 to be calculated from metered electricity consumption and supplier-specific, local grid, or other published emission factors and documented appropriately (GHG Protocol, Chapter 6: "Scope 2 GHG emissions will primarily be calculated from metered electricity consumption and supplier-specific, local grid, or other published emission factors.").
- It also specifies verifiers will expect energy consumption invoices, emission factor justification, and measurement accuracy records (GHG Protocol: "Preparing for a GHG verification: lists evidence and documentation verifiers require (energy consumption invoices, production data, emission factors with justification, measurement accuracy records).").
- Inventory quality management guidance requires checking units and conversions and sampling input data for transcription errors (GHG Protocol: "check units and conversions, sample input data for transcription errors, version control.").

Specific dataset issues (scope2.csv) and why they violate the Protocol:
1) Emission factor unit/scale error — facility F03 (row 5):
   - Observed: emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh = 5.0
   - Why invalid: Typical grid EF ranges ~0.05–0.7 tCO2e/MWh. An EF of 5.0 tCO2e/MWh is implausible and strongly suggests the value was entered in kgCO2e/MWh (i.e., 5000 kg/MWh) or another scale error. The GHG Protocol expects emission factors to be expressed in consistent units (tCO2e/MWh) with documented source. This scale error will inflate reported emissions by ~1000x if not corrected.
   - Required fix: Confirm original EF units from source. If EF was in kgCO2e/MWh, convert to tCO2e/MWh by dividing by 1000 (i.e., EF = 0.005 tCO2e/MWh) — but note 0.005 tCO2e/MWh is unusually low; more likely entry was 500 kg/MWh incorrectly entered as 5.0. Verify supplier/grid EF and correct to the documented value (e.g., 0.5 tCO2e/MWh). Recompute total_emissions_tCO2e = electricity_consumed_MWh * corrected_emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh.
   - Verification evidence required: supplier-factor documentation or national grid emission factor source (document URL or invoice) as per GHG Protocol verification checklist.

2) Consumption magnitude/period mismatch — facility F21 (row 18):
   - Observed: electricity_consumed_MWh = 120,000
   - Why invalid: This value is an extreme outlier relative to dataset mean and flags a likely unit or reporting-period mismatch (e.g., kWh entered as MWh, or monthly rather than annual aggregation). The GHG Protocol requires clear documentation of activity data (meter readings/invoices) and consistent reporting periods.
   - Required fix: Check if source meter/invoice is for multiple facilities, aggregated period, or if the unit was kWh (120,000 kWh = 120 MWh). Confirm and convert to canonical MWh. Update documentation (invoice id, period) and recompute emissions.
   - Verification evidence required: original meter readings/invoices showing period and units.

3) Missing critical values (2 rows missing electricity_consumed_MWh; 4 rows missing emission_factors; 2 rows missing total_emissions):
   - Observed: dataset has several missing critical fields.
   - Why invalid: GHG Protocol/verifiers require complete activity data and transparent use of emission factors. Missing consumption or EF prevents reliable calculation; reporting with default or estimated values is acceptable only if properly documented and justified.
   - Required fix: Retrieve missing electricity consumption from meter records or use documented supplier data. For missing emission factors, obtain supplier-specific or grid factor; if using a default, document justification and source.

4) Calculation integrity issue: total_emissions must equal electricity_consumed_MWh * emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh (within tolerance):
   - Observed: Analysis recommends recomputing totals and flags rows where totals do not match computed product.
   - Why invalid: A discrepancy indicates either transcription error or unit mismatch; GHG Protocol expects clear arithmetic consistency and traceable calculations.
   - Required fix: Recompute all total_emissions_tCO2e values programmatically and flag rows outside tolerance (e.g., >1% or >0.1 tCO2e). Document any deliberate rounding or allocation rules.

Assessment against GHG Protocol requirements (summary):
- Completeness: scope2.csv has missing rows and fields; not complete.
- Accuracy and Consistency: presence of scale/unit errors and period mismatches undermines accuracy.
- Transparency and Documentation: required supporting evidence (supplier factors, invoices) not present in dataset; must be attached for verification.
- Reconciliation: Totals must be programmatically verified; current integrity checks show mismatches to be corrected.

Concrete remediation steps (priority-ordered):
Immediate (high priority):
- Correct EF scale for F03: confirm unit from source, correct EF to tCO2e/MWh, recompute total_emissions, and attach supporting documentation (supplier or national grid EF). Re-run totals and update data_quality_flag.
- Correct consumption for F21: verify whether 120,000 is kWh or MWh and whether period is monthly/annual; convert to canonical MWh and recompute emissions; attach invoice/meter evidence.
- Fill missing electricity_consumed_MWh/emission_factors: obtain source documents or use documented default EF (with justification) and flag as estimated where applicable.
- Programmatically recompute total_emissions for all scope2 rows: set total_emissions = electricity_consumed_MWh * emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh and flag any discrepancies >1%.

Short-term (medium priority):
- Standardize reporting period (annual) and include a column for reporting_period_start and end (or period_type) to avoid month/year confusion.
- Implement unit enforcement: require EF in tCO2e/MWh; reject values >2.0 tCO2e/MWh or <0.001 tCO2e/MWh without justification.
- Add data_quality_flag and provenance columns (invoice_id, supplier_factor_source, entry_person, ingestion_timestamp).

Longer-term (lower priority):
- Build automated ETL rules to validate units, ranges, and cross-field consistency on ingest.
- Maintain an evidence folder linking each row to PDF/URL of supplier emission factors and invoices for verification.

Example calculations and checks to run (recommended SQL/ETL rules):
- Recompute totals: UPDATE scope2 SET computed_total = electricity_consumed_MWh * emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh; flag WHERE ABS(total_emissions_tCO2e - computed_total) > GREATEST(0.1, 0.01 * computed_total);
- EF plausibility: SELECT * FROM scope2 WHERE emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh > 2.0 OR emission_factor_tCO2e_per_MWh < 0.001;
- Consumption plausibility: flag consumption > historical mean + 3*stddev or > regional industry benchmark.

Verification checklist to satisfy GHG Protocol (must attach these for each facility/row):
- Meter readings or supplier invoices showing electricity_consumed and period.
- Source and units for emission factor (supplier-specific contract, country grid factor link), with date and method (location-based vs market-based) clearly indicated.
- Calculation showing multiplication and result with any conversion factors.
- Data quality flag indicating whether value is measured, derived, or estimated and justification for defaults.

Conclusion:
- At present, the scope 2 calculations cannot be certified valid under the GHG Protocol because of unit/scale errors (notably F03), reporting-period/unit inconsistencies (F21), missing data, and mismatched totals. These issues are rectifiable by following the remediation steps above, documenting all corrections with source evidence, and recomputing totals programmatically. Once corrected, re-run the quality checks and provide the evidence package to confirm compliance with GHG Protocol verification requirements.

Saved outputs and next steps I can run for you (if you want):
- Produce a CSV listing the flagged scope2 rows (F03, F21, rows with missing EF/consumption) with suggested corrected values and links to the exact GHG Protocol guidance pages.
- Run automated corrections where safe (e.g., convert EF if confirmed to be kg->t) and produce a corrected scope2.csv with audit trail.
