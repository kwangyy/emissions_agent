# Question 1 Report

## Question
Should employee business travel be classified as Scope 1 or Scope 3? Explain the reasoning and describe how I can calculate my business travel emissions?

## Answer
Employee business travel should be reported as Scope 3 (Category: employee business travel) unless the fuel combustion is from vehicles owned or under the company\u2019s operational control (in which case that fuel combustion is Scope 1). Reasoning: GHG Protocol explicitly lists employee business travel under Scope 3 transportation-related activities and instructs that such emissions be calculated from activity data (passenger miles/kilometers) and published emission factors. Calculation steps: collect trip-level activity (mode, distance or fuel), apply appropriate emission factors (kgCO2e per passenger-km or per unit fuel), sum and report as Scope 3; for company-owned vehicles use fuel data and report under Scope 1. From your loaded data: Scope 1 = 3,420.7 tCO2 and Scope 2 = 1,142.3 tCO2e; scope3 data is not present in the current files, so employee business travel is not yet quantified. I saved the full, sourced analysis and step-by-step calculation guidance as outputs/question_1_report.md.
