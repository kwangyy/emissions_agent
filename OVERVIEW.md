# Emissions Agent: Technical Solution Overview

- Designed to make emissions data analysis accessible, accurate, and compliant with the GHG Protocol.  
- Ingests Scope 1â€“3 CSV inventories and regulatory PDFs (GHG Protocol, peer reports) to generate summaries, answer queries, and perform quality checks with citations.  

## Technical Approach & Architecture
- Modular roles for ingestion, analysis, compliance, and reporting.  
- CSV processed with pandas for aggregations, hotspot detection, and data quality checks (missing factors, negative values, inconsistent units).  
- PDFs embedded into ChromaDB, chunked for semantic search, returning relevant passages with citations for auditability.  
- Queries trigger both structured CSV analysis and semantic PDF retrieval, then cross-reference results for combined outputs.  

## Key Observations
- Scope 1: 124 records covering combustion and fugitive emissions.  
- Scope 2: 86 records for purchased electricity and steam.  
- Scope 3: 210 records across 15+ categories, highest variability.  
- Data issues include missing emission factors, inconsistent units, and supply chain gaps.  
- Regulatory PDFs integrated cleanly into vector DB, enabling precise retrieval of GHG Protocol and peer benchmarks.  

## Scaling Considerations
- PostgreSQL or ClickHouse for large emissions datasets with columnar storage and partitioning.  
- Pinecone or Weaviate for enterprise-scale vector retrieval with consistent embedding schemas.  
- Caching layer (Redis) for repeated queries and frequently accessed regulatory sections.  

## Improvements
- Interactive dashboard with drill-through from scope totals to categories and facility-level records, all with citations.  
- Data contracts at ingest with schema and unit validation to prevent silent errors.  
- Guardrails for answerability checks, refusals on insufficient context, and continuous evaluation sets tied to core questions.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- Data quality issues mitigated with schema validation, unit normalization, and automated anomaly flagging.  
- Consistency and reproducibility enforced through deterministic pipelines, fixed embedding seeds, and run manifests.  
- Hallucination control with attribution thresholds, returning partial answers with explicit data gaps when retrieval confidence is low.
